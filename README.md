# React Redux Practice

This repository contains three small exercises that demonstrate the use of Redux and related concepts in React. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of Redux and its toolkit.

## Exercises

### 1. Counter
- Simple counter application.
- Demonstrates basic Redux concepts such as store, state, actions, and reducers.
- Provides a clear example of how to increment and decrement a counter using Redux.

### 2. Pokemon List (Poke API)
- Fetches a list of Pokémon from the Poke API using Axios.
- Illustrates how to handle asynchronous actions in Redux using Redux Thunk middleware.
- Displays a list of Pokémon and allows you to load more.

### 3. JSONPlaceholder Todos (RTK Query)
- Retrieves a list of todos from the JSONPlaceholder.typicode.com API using RTK Query.
- Demonstrates how to use RTK Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
- Displays a list of todos with features like loading, error handling, and pagination.

## Concepts Covered

- Redux: Centralized state management.
- Store: Holds the state of the application.
- Middlewares: Used for handling asynchronous actions (e.g., Redux Thunk).
- Dispatch: Dispatches actions to update the state.
- Actions: Plain JavaScript objects that describe changes to the state.
- State: Represents the current data and application state.
- Asynchronous Actions: Handling async operations within Redux (e.g., fetching data).
- RTK Query: A library for data fetching, caching, and state management.
- Redux Toolkit: A set of tools and abstractions for Redux development.
- Slices: Modular way to define reducers and actions in Redux.
